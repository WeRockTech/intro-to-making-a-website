Introduction to making a website with GitHub pages

## Steps

- [ ] 1. Create a *free* **GitHub** account. *(Note your username will be part of your URL)*
- [ ] 2. Create an **Open Source** repository. *(Note The name of this is important as it will be part of your URL)*

Two repository name options:

   - `username.github.io` this will be the URL for your website
   - `any-name` the URL would be `username.github.io/any-name`

- [ ] 3. Check the repository settings under the `settings` tab, then towards the end under `GitHub Pages` section, select the right branch. *(Note default branch is master on a new repository)*

- [ ] 4. Create a file called `index.html` with some text and wait a minute to see the deployed changes. Ask a friend to take a look at your website that is live on the internet.
- [ ] 5. Add some content with **html** to this file, for example `<h1>Hello world</h1>` and see how this effects the deployed changes
- [ ] 6. Add more content to the same file, for example `<p>My name is Eddie</p>`
- [ ] 7. Lets add some styling, change `<p style="color:blue">My name is Eddie</p>`
